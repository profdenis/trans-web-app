# Part 1

Write a function to determine if a string is a palindrome or not. A string is a
palindrome if it can be read in both directions (forward and backward) in the
same way. Examples: "radar" is a palindrome, "hello" is not a palindrome. Try
doing it with a single loop.

# Part 2

Write a function to determine if a number is even or odd.

# Part 3

Write a function that will take a string as an argument, and return the reverse
of that string.

# Part 4

Write a function that will take a character and a string as arguments, and
return the number of occurrences of the character in the string.

# Part 5

Write a program that will test the functions in the other parts. This program
should have a menu with 4 choices (1 to 4), for each of the previous parts. Once
a part has been selected by the user, your program will ask the user for the
necessary inputs (a string for Part 1, an integer for Part 2, ... ), call the
function, and print the results in a nicely formatted way.
