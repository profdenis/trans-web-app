\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\subsection*{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

Web applications play an increasingly important role in society. In this
course, students design and build data-centric Web applications that
support information transactions for commercial, communication, and
other purposes. Using industry-standard Web-development technologies and
best practices, students are guided in the development, implementation,
and deployment of relevant Web applications.

\hypertarget{courses-role-in-the-program}{%
\subsection*{Course's role in the
program}\label{courses-role-in-the-program}}

This course completes the exploration of transactional Web applications
that has been started in the Front-End Web Programming course by
providing the tools to develop the code that resides on the Web
application server and that interacts with a database management system
or other information service as part of a complete transactional Web
application.

\hypertarget{statement-of-course-competencies}{%
\subsection*{Statement of course
competencies}\label{statement-of-course-competencies}}

The competency \textbf{00SU Develop transactional Web applications} will
be developed and finalized in this course. The competency was introduced
and developed in the Front-End Web Programming course.

\item
  Apply internationalization and localization techniques
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{required-reading-material-textbook}{%
\subsection*{Required reading material
(Textbook)}\label{required-reading-material-textbook}}

There is no required textbook for this course. Lecture notes will be

\hypertarget{late-work}{%
\subsubsection*{Late work}\label{late-work}}

A 10\% penalty for each late day will be applied on assignments
submitted after the deadline. The project (LIA) and the exam cannot be
submitted late. Exceptions can only be granted only according to the
College policies and procedures.

\hypertarget{project-learning-integration-assessment}{%
\subsection*{Project (Learning Integration
Assessment)}\label{project-learning-integration-assessment}}

Students work in groups to create, implement, and deploy a transactional
web application that incorporates the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  User registration, authentication, and authorization, including
  two-factor authentication with QR code.
\item
  Prevention of common security risks such as SQL injection and
  cross-site scripting (XSS).
\item
  Implementing CRUD transactions
\item
  Internalization and localization
\item
  Reading data from online sources (Web APIs)
\item
  Developed using a Behaviour-Driven Development methodology, complete
  with a test suite automated with an appropriate framework, such as
  Behat.
\end{itemize}

Scope of the transactional web application:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The scope should be representative of a typical small scale eCommerce
  application that can be developed by a team of two or three people.
\item
  Each student in this project implements ten user requirements, which
  are expressed as complete user stories written by the students
  themselves.
\item
  Upon completion, students present their web application and prepare a
  project report.
\end{itemize}
