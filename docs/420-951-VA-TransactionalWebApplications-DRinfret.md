## Course Description

Web applications play an increasingly important role in society. In this
course, students design and build data-centric Web applications that
support information transactions for commercial, communication, and
other purposes. Using industry-standard Web-development technologies and
best practices, students are guided in the development, implementation,
and deployment of relevant Web applications.

## Course's role in the program

This course completes the exploration of transactional Web applications
that has been started in the Front-End Web Programming course by
providing the tools to develop the code that resides on the Web
application server and that interacts with a database management system
or other information service as part of a complete transactional Web
application.

## Statement of course competencies

The competency **00SU Develop transactional Web applications** will be
developed and finalized in this course. The competency was introduced
and developed in the Front-End Web Programming course.

## Course-level Learning Outcome

Develop transactional Web applications.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Program transactional Web applications following the industry best practices.

- Apply a widely used design pattern, such as MVC
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Apply appropriate security measures
- Implement database transactions (CRUD)
- Retrieve data from online sources, such as from Web APIs (JSON)
- Apply testing procedures such as automated testing in a Behaviour-Driven
  Development methodology
- Use proper collaboration tools for development and issue-tracking
- Apply internationalization and localization techniques

## Required reading material (Textbook)

There is no required textbook for this course. Lecture notes will be
provided through Omnivox, along with a list of recommended readings and
tutorials. The list will be updated throughout the course as needed.

## Grading Scheme

| Component     | Grade | Approx. due date |
|---------------|-------|------------------|
| Assignment 1  | 20%   | Dec. 12          |
| Assignment 2  | 20%   | Jan. 16          |
| Project (LIA) | 30%   | Feb. 10          |
| Exam          | 30%   | Jan. 27          |

### Late work

A 10% penalty for each late day will be applied on assignments submitted
after the deadline. The project (LIA) and the exam cannot be submitted late.
Exceptions can only be granted only according to the College policies and
procedures.

## Project (Learning Integration Assessment)

Students work in groups to create, implement, and deploy a transactional web
application that incorporates the
following features:

- User registration, authentication, and authorization, including two-factor
  authentication with QR code.
- Prevention of common security risks such as SQL injection and cross-site
  scripting (XSS).
- Implementing CRUD transactions
- Internalization and localization
- Reading data from online sources (Web APIs)
- Developed using a Behaviour-Driven Development methodology, complete with
  a test suite automated with an appropriate framework, such as Behat.

Scope of the transactional web application:

- The scope should be representative of a typical small scale eCommerce
  application that can be developed by a team of two or three people.
- Each student in this project implements ten user requirements, which are
  expressed as complete user stories written by the students themselves.

- Upon completion, students present their web application and prepare a project
  report.

### Evaluation criteria for the learning integration assessment

The following criteria are considered in the evaluation of the project
deliverables:

- In the implementation:
    - Respect of the selected design pattern (such as MVC).
    - Correct validation of data inputs (form data inputs).
    - Adequate corrective actions to ensure platform security.
    - Reasonable consideration of User Experience.
    - Appropriate design of User Interface.
    - Appropriate test suite.
- In the documentation:
    - Correct presentation of work completed.
    - Correct demonstration of product usability.
- In the presentation, clear communication of
    - Project objectives, need addressed, and target user-base.
    - Difficulties met in the project and solutions.
    - Lessons learned.

### Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Project proposal
- Deliverable 2: HTML & CSS
- Deliverable 3: Project Implementation
- Deliverable 4: Project report and presentation

### SPLI

The quality of English expression will be evaluated and be worth 10% of
the total as part of grading the LIA written reports and in-class
presentations.

## Teaching Methodology

Programming exercises and discussion on sample programs can take place
either during the lecture time or lab period. All meetings will be held
**online** at the time of the scheduled classes using Zoom, through the link
provided on Omnivox.

## College policies & Procedures

There is a set of College policies and procedures covering the rights and
responsibilities of both faculty and students. These cover grade review,
student-faculty mediation, sexual harassment, standing and advancement,
cheating and plagiarism, absences for religious holidays.

Note that students who observe religious holidays during the semester must
inform the instructor, in writing, before the end of the first day of online
class. Consult _Religious Holy Day Absences (see IPESA, Section 2.2.6)_. It is
your responsibility to be aware of the various policies and procedures
governing your rights and obligations while you are attending
Vanier College.

Consult _Student Academic Complaints (see 7210-8), Code of Conduct:
[http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/bylaws-policies-procedures/code-of-conduct/](http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/bylaws-policies-procedures/code-of-conduct/)
, Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (see 7210-33)_ and as well
as any teacher or course-specific rules/guidelines that students should
adhere to (see Appendix 2).

## Respecting Privacy during Synchronous Online Classes

The instructor might proceed for recording the student's image and voice in the
context of online synchronous lectures or labs class. Students will
be asked for their permission and agreement through form or MIO. The
recording will only be available to other students in the group through and will
be deleted once the block has ended.

## Respecting Intellectual Property Rights in Online Classes

Any material produced as part of the course, including, but not limited to, 
any pre-recorded or live video is protected by copyright, intellectual property
rights and image rights, regardless of the medium used. It is strictly forbidden

or modify this material. Any contravention of these conditions of use may be 
subject to sanction(s) by the College under the Code of Conduct.

## Cheating & Plagiarism

Any form of cheating or plagiarism will result in a grade zero for that exam or

A repeated offence may lead to more serious consequences. Consult The Vanier 
Student Writing Guide, the Vanier Catalogue, The Student Handbook, Cheating 
and Plagiarism (see 7210-31), Student Misconduct in the Classroom (7210-19) 
and your teacher for more information.

## Attendance requirement

Students are responsible for material discussed during class time even
when they are absent. The material covered in class may be different
from what is presented in referenced material. Written and spoken class
material may be part of exams. There is no grade for attendance, but
