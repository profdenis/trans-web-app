## ORM and Databases

- **ORM**: _Object-Relational Mapping_ (or _Mapper_)
- General steps to use an ORM such as [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.
  org/), directly or through the
  [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)
  wrapper
    1. Define models as classes in Python
    2. Create the tables corresponding to the models using the ORM
        - this will end up executing SQL statements, such as `CREATE TABLE`
          statements
        - but you don't have to explicitly write the SQL statements, the ORM
          will do it for you
    3. Add instances of the model classes through the ORM
        - `INSERT INTO` statements will be generated and executed by the ORM
    4. Query the DB through the models or the DB session
        - there are 2 main ways to query the DB:
            1. the legacy interface, using `model.query`
            2. the recommended way (since version 3 of Flask-SQLAlchemy), using
               `db.session.execute`
        - You don't normally need to use SQL directly while using the ORM,
          except for some special queries that cannot be (easily) expressed with
          the ways mentioned above

## Project: `flask_mvc`

This is a small project to show how to set up an ORM, define models, and
query the models (i.e. query the DB). In this project, the views (the
templates) and the controllers (the routes) are kept simple, and the focus
is placed on the models. To begin with, there are only 2 models,
corresponding to 1 table each, so there are no many-to-many relationships in
this example.

### File `models.py`

[Doc](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/models/)

Here is a diagram representing the DB:

![contact_call.png](images/contact_call.png)

It is a simplified contacts DB that could be used on a mobile phone. It
records the name, the phone number, the address and the email of contacts,
and a history phone calls. There's a foreign key from `call` to `contact`,
which is optional in case there's no contact associated to a given phone
number.

We start by defining the `Contact` model.

````python
class Contact(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'contact'
    contact_id = db.Column(db.Integer(), primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    name = db.Column(db.Text(), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.Text())
    phone = db.Column(db.Text())
    address = db.Column(db.Text())
    calls = db.relationship('Call', backref='contact', lazy=True)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Contact {self.contact_id}: {self.name}>"
````

For now, just ignore the `calls` field, which will be explained later.
Setting the `__tablename__` and defining the `__repr__` method is optional,
but this way it can make it easier to work with the models in some situations.

We define a field for each attribute in the DB design. Refer to the
[doc](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/type_basics.html) for
more details on all the data types available. The constraints are specified
as arguments to the `db.Column` constructor. In this model, only the
`contact_id` and the name are mandatory, all the other ones are optional (i.
e. can be null).

Then we define the `Call` model.

````python
class Call(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'call'
    call_id = db.Column(db.Integer(), primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    phone = db.Column(db.Text(), nullable=False)
    datetime = db.Column(db.DateTime(), nullable=False,
                         default=datetime.datetime.now)
    contact_id = db.Column(db.Integer(), db.ForeignKey('contact.contact_id'))

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Call {self.call_id}: {self.phone} {self.contact_id}>"
````

There's an example of setting a default value for a column, in this case the
`datetime` column. The default value can be a fixed value, or it can be a
function that's going to be called whenever necessary.

The `contact_id` column in the `Call` model is a foreign key to the
`Contact` model. A `db.ForeignKey` constraint is given to specify the foreign
key. So given a call, it will be easy to find the contact for the call (if
any). In some situations, it may be necessary to do the reverse, to know which
calls correspond to a specific contact, or in other words, find all the
calls with a given `contact_id`. Defining the `calls` field in `Contact`
model will make this easy since, given an instance of `Contact`, we will be
able to access all the calls associated to the contact through the `calls`
field. It is marked as a `backref` since it is, in a sense, the reverse of
the foreign key from `Call`.

`calls` is not going to be a column in the `contact` table in the DB.
Instead, a query will be executed to find all the calls corresponding to the
contact. It is labelled as *lazy* because if not, we could end up query all
the calls of all contacts when we may not need them, and it could cause bad
performance on large databases. The `calls` field will be available
automatically with the legacy query interface, but not with the
`db.session.execute` method. More on this later.

### File `manage.py`

This file is used when we start a flask shell.

After creating a new model, if the corresponding table in the DB doesn't
already exist, we need to create it. We could write a `CREATE TABLE`
statement to create, but it would be easy to make a mistake and end up with
a table that doesn't exactly match the model, because of non-matching names
or data types for example. The easiest way is to tell SQLAlchemy to
automatically create the tables corresponding to our models. It will only
create the missing tables, so it is easy to add a new model and create its
corresponding table without messing up the existing models/tables.

The `manage.py` file includes a function that will be called automatically
if we start a *flask shell*. Open a terminal window in Pycharm, then execute
the command `flask shell`. From there, you will be able to call
`db.create_all()` to create the tables for the new models without touching
the existing tables. Don't forget to commit your changes after creating the
tables.

````python
from app import app
from models import db, Contact, Call


@app.shell_context_processor
def make_shell_context():
    return dict(app=app, db=db, Contact=Contact, Call=Call)
````

### Adding and querying data through the flask shell

It is possible to add data to the DB through the flask shell. The methods
used are the same as the one we will need to use in the routes. The
difference is where the data comes from. In the routes, the data might come
from the forms, while in the flask shell, we will probably just make up some
data for testing. It is also possible to write a script that will add some
data to the DB through the ORM.

1. Create an instance of `Contact`: `contact = Contact(name='Denis')`
2. Add it to the DB: `db.session.add(contact)`
3. Repeat if desired, possibly by specifying more column values:
   `contact = Contact(name='Bob', email='bob@example.com')`
4. Commit your changes: `db.session.commit()`
5. You can also commit after each call to `add`
6. You will not know immediately if there are any issues with the new
   contacts, for example you will not know if there are broken constraints
   after you add the new contact
7. You will only know after you commit, that's why it might be better to
   commit after each `add`
8. You can use `db.session.rollback()` to undo all your changes since the
   last commit

You can add data to `Call` in a similar fashion.

````python
import datetime

db.session.add(Call(phone='1112223333'))
db.session.add(Call(phone='5552223333', contact_id=1))
db.session.add(Call(phone='5552223333',
                    datetime=datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1),
                    contact_id=1))
db.session.commit()
````

#### Querying with the legacy interface

[Doc](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/queries/#querying-records)

With this interface, we need to go through the model to get the data. To get
all the contacts, we can do `contacts = Contact.query.all()`. We will get a
list of `Contact` objects. Instead of `all()`, we can do `first()` to get
only the first result. We won't get a list in this, but just an instance of
`Contact`, or `None` if there aren't any results. With `first()`, an empty
list will be returned if there aren't any results.

We can use `filter_by` on `query` for simple equality filters, such as
`contacts = Contact.query.filter_by(name='Bob').all()`.

With `filter` instead of `filter_by`, we need to refer to the model's fields to
specify condition, we cannot use `name` directly. The equivalent query to
the previous is `contacts = Contact.query.filter(Contact.name=='Bob').all()`.
Note
the double equal `==` here. As opposed to `filter_by`, `filter` accepts a
condition, not a value for a specific column. Therefore, `filter` is much
more flexible than `filter_by`. You can use `where` instead of `filter` if
you prefer.

To filter on `null` or `not null` values, since we are using Python, we have
to use `None` instead of `null`.

````python
contacts = Contact.query.filter(Contact.email == None).all()
contacts = Contact.query.filter(Contact.email != None).all()
contacts = Contact.query.filter(Contact.email.isnot(None)).all()
````

The last 2 are equivalent, and opposite of the first one.

When querying for calls, you can access the `contact_id` field of a call to
know which contact it corresponds to. You will get an integer or `None` if
there's no associated contact. You can also access the `contact` attribute
of a call to get an instance of a contact the call corresponds to. It's not
a real field, there's no column or columns in `call` containing the full
contact data. `contact` in this case is really a getter that's going to
query the `contact` model and build a full instance the corresponding contact.

````python
call = Call.query.filter_by(call_id=1).first()
print(call)  # prints <Call 1: 1112223333 None>
print(call.contact_id)  # prints None
print(call.contact)  # prints None
call = Call.query.filter_by(call_id=1).first()
print(call)  # prints <Call 2: 5552223333 1>
print(call.contact_id)  # prints 1
print(call.contact)  # prints <Contact 1: Denis>
````

When querying by primary key, it is more convenient, and possibly faster, to
use the `get` method. Because we query by primary key, we know for sure we
cannot get more than 1 result, so we get a `Contact` instance, or `None` if
the contact was not found. Alternatively, when in a route, you can use
`get_or_404`. You use it the same way as `get`, except that instead or
returning `None` is not found, a *404 Not Found* will be returned from the
route.

````python
contact = Contact.query.get(1)
print(contact)  # prints <Contact 1: Denis>
contact = Contact.query.get(4)
print(contact)  # prints None
````

From a contact instance, we can use the `backref` to access all the calls
associated to a contact. Here again, the ORM will query the DB to get these
associated calls.

````python
contact = Contact.query.get(1)
print(contact)  # prints <Contact 1: Denis>
print(contact.calls)  # prints [<Call 2: 5552223333 1>, <Call 3: 5552223333 1>]
````

Although very convenient, we have to be careful using the legacy interface.
It can become very inefficient over large databases. Creating model
instances can be expensive if the number of rows in the results is large,
and/or if the number of columns in the table is large. If, for example, we
only need 3 columns of a table out of, say, 50 columns, then creating an
instance will require all 50 columns values, even if we are going to use
only 3. If the number of rows is large, that's even worse.

The `backref` is defined as lazy to avoid building the list representing the
`backref` all the time, possibly for nothing.

#### Querying with `db.session.execute`

[Doc](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/queries/#select)

[Doc](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/queryguide.html)

The big difference between the two querying methods is that with the legacy
interface, we get instances or lists of instances of the model classes,
while with `db.session.execute`, we can get list of rows more easily,
similar to what
we would get if we were executing SQL statements directly on the DB. We
still get SQL injection protection, but model instances are not created
automatically in all cases. This is less convenient in some cases, but it
can be more efficient on
large tables and databases since we don't need to retrieve all columns all
the time. And we can control more precisely the queries that are sent to the
DB.

In the first example, we get all the calls. If we loop directly on the
`result`, we get tuples, each containing 1 `Call` instance.

````python
result = db.session.execute(db.select(Call))
for res in result:
    print(res)
# prints 
# (<Call 1: 1112223333 None>,)
# (<Call 2: 5552223333 1>,)
# (<Call 3: 5552223333 1>,)
````

If we loop on `result.scalars()`, we get the `Call` instances directly instead.

````python
result = db.session.execute(db.select(Call))
for res in result.scalars():
    print(res)
# prints
# <Call 1: 1112223333 None>
# <Call 2: 5552223333 1>
# <Call 3: 5552223333 1>
````

If we don't want to retrieve all the columns, we can do something like this.

````python
result = db.session.execute(db.select(Call.call_id, Call.datetime))
for res in result:
    print(res)
# prints
# (1, datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 4, 21, 22, 16, 777713))
# (2, datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 4, 21, 22, 40, 763128))
# (3, datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 0, 0))
````

Because we did not specify whole models to select, we get tuples of data
instead of model instances.

### Joins

With the legacy interface, when we use `call.contact`, we are implicitly
doing a join for the specific `Call` instance. Similarly, accessing `contact.
calls` involves a join. We can also use the `join` method on the result of
query to perform joins, similar to the examples included below using `execute`.

To be able to do any kind of join, we can use a `select` with multiple
tables. But be careful, if you don't specify any join conditions,
using either the `join` or the `where` methods, then you will end up with a
cartesian product.

````python
result = db.session.execute(db.select(Call, Contact))
for res in result:
    print(res)
# prints
# (<Call 1: 1112223333 None>, <Contact 1: Denis>)
# (<Call 1: 1112223333 None>, <Contact 2: Bob>)
# (<Call 2: 5552223333 1>, <Contact 1: Denis>)
# (<Call 2: 5552223333 1>, <Contact 2: Bob>)
# (<Call 3: 5552223333 1>, <Contact 1: Denis>)
# (<Call 3: 5552223333 1>, <Contact 2: Bob>)
````

All the following 3 ways give the same results.

````python
result = db.session.execute(db.select(Call, Contact)
                            .where(Call.contact_id == Contact.contact_id))
result = db.session.execute(db.select(Call, Contact).join(Contact))
result = db.session.execute(db.select(Call, Contact).join(Contact,
                                                          Call.contact_id == Contact.contact_id))
for res in result:
    print(res)
# prints 
# (<Call 2: 5552223333 1>, <Contact 1: Denis>)
# (<Call 3: 5552223333 1>, <Contact 1: Denis>)
````

The first way will produce the following SQL query. It's really a cartesian
product followed by a filter on a condition, which is equivalent to a join.

````sql
SELECT *
FROM call,
     contact
WHERE call.contact_id == contact.contact_id
````

The other 2 ways will produce the same SQL query, but with the last one, you
have the flexibility to specify the join condition you want.

````sql
SELECT *
FROM call
         INNER JOIN contact ON call.contact_id == contact.contact_id
````

## Example of a many-many relationship (from chatGPT)

### Question

Can you give me an example of a many-many relationship using flask and SQLAlchemy?

### Answer

Certainly! Here is an example of how you might define a many-to-many
relationship using Flask and SQLAlchemy:

````python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()


class Student(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    courses = db.relationship('Course', secondary='student_courses',
                              backref='students')


class Course(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'courses'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)


class StudentCourses(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'student_courses'
    student_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('students.id'),
                           primary_key=True)
    course_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('courses.id'),
                          primary_key=True)
````

In this example, we have defined three models: `Student`, `Course`, and
`StudentCourses`. The `Student` and `Course` models have a many-to-many 
relationship, which is represented by the courses relationship in the 
`Student` model and the students relationship in the `Course` model. The 
`StudentCourses` model represents the join table between `Student` and 
`Course`, and contains foreign keys to both tables.

To create a new student and add them to a course, you could do something like
this:

````python
student = Student(name='Alice')
course = Course(name='Computer Science')
student.courses.append(course)
db.session.add(student)
db.session.commit()
````

This would create a new student named Alice and a new course named Computer
Science, and it would add Alice to the course. The changes would be persisted to
the database when you call `db.session.commit()`.
