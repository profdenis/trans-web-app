- *Flask* is a web development *micro*framework
    - *micro* in microframework means Flask aims to keep the core *simple* but
      *extensible*
    - *Flask won’t make many decisions for you*, such as what database to use.
    - Those decisions that it does make, such as what templating engine to use,
      are easy to change
    - Everything else is *up to you*, so that Flask can be everything you need
      and nothing you don’t

## Flask Basics

### First Web Site

- Flask's *hello world* program is very simple compared to other web frameworks
- We need a Python environment with the *Flask* package installed
    - first option: use this command in a Python virtual environment
        - `pip install Flask`
        - more details here:
          [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#installation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#installation)
    - second option (recommended): use PyCharm to simplify creating and updating
      Python virtual environments and Flask projects
        - create a new project
        - select *Flask* as the project type
        - select an existing Python virtual environment to use or create a new
          one
            - note: you should probably not create a new Python virtual
              environment for each project since you will have to reinstall all
              the necessary packages in each environment and use up more disk
              space in the process


- PyCharm will automatically create a basic Flask project for you
- In the `app.py` file, you will have code similar to the code given below

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def hello_world():  # put application's code here
    return 'Hello World!'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

- Code examples available in project `02_flask_basics`
    - Note that usually, a Flask project would contain only one *main*
      file, `app.py`, to start the development web server
    - To reduce the number of different projects, many *main* files have been
      grouped together for the examples
    - In real life, a project would have only 1 `app.py` file

### Code Overview

- We always need to import the `Flask` class from the `flask` package
- We create a Flask `app` by creating an instance of the `Flask` class
- ` @app.route('/')` is a function decorator, applying to the following function
  definition
    - it means that when a request to access the root page `/` is sent to the
      server
    - it will execute the `hello_world` function
    - this function simply returns a string containing some simple HTML
    - this string will be sent back to the client (probably a web browser) which
      sent the request
- If `__name__` is `__main__`, then we need to call `app.run()` to start the
  server
    - this will be the case when we run the `app.py` directly
- In production mode, the server is normally started differently (more on this
  later when discussing deployment strategies)

### How to Run

- Run the server
- In your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- You should see *Hello World!* in a `h1` header
- Modify the route to ` @app.route('/hello')`
- Reload in browser: did something change?
- By default in PyCharm, servers do **not** run in *debug* mode
- You need to restart the server to see the changes
- Or modify the run configuration to run the server in debug mode (check the 
  `FLASK_DEBUG` option)
- In debug mode, it will detect changes to source code files and rerun the
  server automatically

### Returning HTML

#### File: `01_app.py`

Normally, we will not return simple text strings, but we will return HTML or 
JSON instead. We will see how to return HTML templates later.

````python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/index')
def hello_world():
    return '<h1>Hello Web App!</h1>'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
````

### `url_for` Example

#### File: `02_app.py`

- Example with 2 endpoints
    - each ` @app.route()` with its associated function is often called an 
      *endpoint*
- The `index` endpoint uses a format string to create an `a` element 
  referring to the other endpoint
- `url_for` takes a function name as its argument, and returns the route
  associated to it
    - in this case, it will return `/hello`
- Why not write `/hello` directly instead of calling `url_for`?
    - in this simple example, we don't need to use `url_for`
    - but in larger project, it's better to use `url_for` in case we need to
      move endpoints around
    - try changing the route for `hello_web_app`, and with `url_for`, you don't
      need to change anything else
    - without `url_for`, you would need to update every reference to it

```python
from flask import Flask, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def index():
    return f'<a href="{url_for("hello_web_app")}">Hello Web App</a>'


@app.route('/hello')
def hello_web_app():
    return '<h1>Hello Web App!</h1>'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### First Template

#### Files: `03_app.py` and `03_index.html`

- Returning full HTML pages this way is a bad idea
    - it would take too much space in the source code
    - it's better to separate the logic code from the presentation code
- Use the `render_template` function to return the HTML code stored in an
  external file
- Usually, template files are stored in the `templates` folder
- By default, Flask uses the *jinja2* package as the template rendering engine

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template("03_index.html")
```

~~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>First Template</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>First Template</h1>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/hello">/hello</a></li>
    <li><a href="/goodbye">/goodbye</a></li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
~~~~

- This template is static, it will always be rendered the same way
- In general, templates are dynamic
    - variables can be passed to the template
    - the template can include loops, conditionals, ... to make the contents
      more dynamic
- Templates provide a skeleton for the page, the contents can change depending
  on the situation
- You can pass variables to a template in this way (file `04_app.py`)

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('04_index.html',
                           hello=url_for('hello_web_app'),
                           goodbye=url_for('goodbye_web_app'))
```

- To get the value of a variable in a template, use the double curly brackets
  notation `{{ }}`
- File: `04_index.html`

~~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Second Template</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Second Template</h1>
<ul>
    <li><a href="{{ hello }}">{{ hello }}</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{ goodbye }}">{{ goodbye}} </a></li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
~~~~

- You can also pass a list to a template (file `05_app.py`)

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    links = [url_for('hello_web_app'), url_for('goodbye_web_app')]
    return render_template('05_index.html', links=links)
```

- You will probably need to use a loop in the template to get all values in the
  list (file `05_index.html`)
- The curly bracket percent notation is used for many template constructs, such
  as loops and conditionals and many others

~~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Second Template</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Second Template</h1>
<ul>
    {% for link in links %}
    <li><a href="{{ link }}">{{ link }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
</body>
</html>
~~~~

### Dynamic Routes

- Routes can also be dynamic
- Routes can contain *variables* (kind of)
- There must be a corresponding parameter in the endpoint function
  (file `06_app.py`)

```python
@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello_name(name):
    return render_template('hello_name.html', name=name)
```

- `<name>` denotes a variable part of the route
- By default, it should be a string not containing any special URL characters
  (such as `/`)
- The `name` parameter will be equal to the part of the route matching `<name>`
- The template can use the name variable as shown earlier, with the `{{ }}`
  notation
